# Netflix PowerBi Dashboard
<ins>**Netflix Subscription Analysis**</ins>

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of Netflix subscription data using Power BI. The project aims to uncover insights about subscription types, monthly revenue trends, and user behavior based on various attributes such as subscription duration, device usage, geographic location, and generational categories.

<ins>**Project Overview**</ins>

**Objective**:
The goal of this project is to analyze Netflix's subscription data to provide insights on user engagement, revenue generation, and customer demographics. Using Power BI, I have visualized key metrics to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

<ins>**Data Source**</ins>

The dataset used in this analysis contains the following columns:
- SubscriptionType: The type of Netflix subscription (e.g., Basic, Standard, Premium)
- MonthlyRevenue: Revenue generated per user per month
- JoinDate: Date when the user subscribed to Netflix
- LastPaymentDate: Date of the user's last payment
- ReformattedJoinDate: Reformatted date for analysis purposes
- ReformattedLastPaymentDate: Reformatted date for analysis purposes
- Country: User's country
- Age: User's age
- Gender: User's gender
- Device: Device used to access Netflix (e.g., mobile, desktop, TV)
- Plan Duration: Length of the subscription in months
- Analysis Breakdown
  
<ins>**Key Metrics**</ins>
- Subscription Duration: I calculated the total number of months a user remained subscribed by comparing JoinDate and LastPaymentDate.
- Revenue Insights: Visualized the monthly revenue generated by users based on subscription types, countries, and demographic factors such as age and gender.
- Customer Segmentation: Segmented the customer base to understand the distribution of subscription plans across different regions, age groups, and generations.
- Generational Categorization: Users were categorized into generational groups based on their age, such as Baby Boomers, Generation X, Millennials, and Generation Z. This allowed us to analyze subscription preferences and behaviors within each generation.
- Device Analysis: Analyzed device usage patterns to see which platforms users prefer for streaming.
